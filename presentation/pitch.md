# Swift and IoT

### The potential and the challenges of running swift on a single-board computer


---

# Not your average swift platform

forget about nice abstractions

forget about detailed documentation (err...)

think GPIO, PWM, raw wire connections and of course burned hardware ðŸ˜±

---

# Enter IoT

low level hardware programming with swift

...on a platform where it's not officially meant to run, the Raspberry Pi

---

# Workshop goals

control an RC car from an iOS device via WiFi. Only swift code allowed!

program the iOS app and the car brains, running on a Raspberry Pi

get to know servo motors, understand PWM

get your hands dirty with low level programming and hardware topics

have fun! (without burning the Pis)

---

# Problems to solve

user input collection

low latency networking

wiring up a single board computer to an RC car

controlling servo motors and ESCs with swift

deal with an unstable and unsupported architecture
